    <div><p>Rust for Lunch is an online-only Rust meet scheduled to fit into a lunch break.</p>
<p>The main part of each meet-up will be short enough to fit into a 1 hour lunch
slot and the time is chosen to be a feasible lunch time.</p>
<p>The first meet-up will be scheduled around European and African midday and
early afternoon.</p>
