Rust for Lunch is an online-only Rust meet scheduled to fit into a lunch break.

The main part of each meet-up will be short enough to fit into a 1 hour lunch
slot and the time is chosen to be a feasible lunch time.

The first meet-up will be scheduled around European and African midday and
early afternoon.
