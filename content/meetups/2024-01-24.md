### Implementing a Rust virtual machine monitor for Nushift

#### Speaker: [David Pollack](https://github.com/davepollack)

Nushift is a platform that attempts to be an alternative to the web that has
the advantage of shareable URLs, but provides different ABIs/APIs to the web.
We discuss the Rust implementation of these APIs, including the organisation
into subsystems and the support of requirements like deferred execution.
