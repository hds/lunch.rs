### Formal verification for Rust with coq-of-rust

#### Speaker: [Guillaume Claret](https://github.com/clarus)

With formal verification, we can assert that a program contains no bugs for a
specification, covering all execution cases. We present coq-of-rust
https://github.com/formal-land/coq-of-rust , a formal verification tool for
Rust that we developed. It works by translating Rust programs to the proof
system Coq.
