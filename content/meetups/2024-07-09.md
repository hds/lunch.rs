### Using category theory to parse command line options

#### Speaker: [Michael Baykov](https://functional.cafe/@manpacket)

We are going to talk about side effects in Rust and how to manage them using
abstractions from Category Theory using command line options parsing as an
example. No prior knowledge in either Category Theory or command line options
parsing is required, being able to read Rust code and look at pretty pictures
should be enough ðŸ™‚
