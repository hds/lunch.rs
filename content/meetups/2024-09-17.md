### Let's write an HTTP server in Rust

#### Speaker: [Hayden Stainsby](https://hegdenu.net/)

Bring your copy of [RFC 2616](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616), we're going to write
an HTTP server!

This will be a group implementation session, where we'll do our best to get a `curl`-compliant HTTP
server responding with something simple by the end of our lunch break.

#### The result

We managed to get a server working with some basic error handling as well as responding to a happy
path request with a body. The code has been left exactly as it was at the end of the meet-up, `dbg!`
statements and all!

The code can be found on GitHub [hds/lunch.rs](https://github.com/hds/lunch.rs):
