### Talk 1: Deterministic Execution Time Control for Arbitrary WASM

#### Speaker: [Bohdan Ivashko (arriven)](https://github.com/arriven)

Sometimes you may need to run an arbitrary wasm code while being able to
impose limits on CPU and memory usage. While having precise memory limits is
relatively easy, controlling the CPU limits in a reproducible way is a totally
different can of worms (Spoiler: it's counting instructions, we'll have to
count instructions, but we'll have to do it somewhat efficiently, and we'll do
it by analyzing and modifying the original code).

### Talk 2: Adventures in Fearless Parallelism

#### Speaker: Christian Vetter
