The April 2024 Rust for Lunch meet-up will be dedicated to lightning talks.
Each talk will be given 5 minutes for the talk and 2 minutes for questions.

If you would like to reserve a place for a lightning talk before the meet-up
(which is probably a good idea), then please [contact us](@/about.md#contact).
Empty slots, if there are any, will be filled by people who show up on the day
and would like to speak.

We'd like to remind everyone that all participants (speakers, moderators, and
attendees) must follow the [Code of Conduct](@/about.md#code-of-conduct) during
the meetup.
